# Description of the Project

This README provides an overview of the AirBnB clone project, focusing on the initial backend development and its integration with a console application using Python's `cmd` module.

## Backend Development

The project began with the creation of backend infrastructure, which involved:

- Generating Python objects to represent data.
- Storing this data in a JSON file.
- Utilizing Python's `json` module for data access.

## Console Application Integration

The console application operates in two modes:

### Interactive Mode

In Interactive mode, the console displays a prompt `(hbnb)`, indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is executed, the prompt reappears, awaiting a new command. This cycle continues indefinitely until the user exits the program.

### Non-Interactive Mode

In Non-Interactive mode, commands can be executed without the need for manual input. This mode may be suitable for automated processes or batch operations.

The integration of backend functionality with the console application allows for seamless interaction with the AirBnB clone system.

This README serves as a guide for understanding the project structure and initial implementation steps.
